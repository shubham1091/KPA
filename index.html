                    <p>Like you, I balance academics, work, and the search for community in a demanding environment. Whether you've seen me studying in the library, chatting in campus cafés ☕, or attending KPA events, you know I'm approachable and genuinely invested in our postgraduate community.</p>
                    <p>The KPA transformed my Keele experience by providing a welcoming community when I needed it most. Now, I want to give back by serving as your Secretary – not for the title, but to ensure every postgraduate student feels supported, heard, and valued.</p>
